# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

This repository contains 2 contracts for deployment of BEP-20 token
One token has been deployed to 0xDF823730CC7CCA5D39B2CB007D02717792fA60D4 (BSC Testnet)
